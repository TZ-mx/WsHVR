# WsHVR
The paper proposes a wireless sensing-based human-vehicle recognition (WsHVR) method based on deep learning, which can be applied in ISLSs that assembled with Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). To solve the problem of limited recognition ability of wireless sensing technology, the paper proposes a deep feature extraction model that combines multi-scale convolution and attention mechanism. The received signal strength (RSS) features of road users are extracted by multi-scale convolution. WsHVR integrates an Adaptive Registration Convolutional Attention Mechanism (ARCAM) to further feature extraction and classification. The final normalized classification result is obtained by Softmax activation function.
